# Tripal HQ Imports

Tripal HQ provides a user-contributed content control center and administrative toolbox for your Tripal site. Tripal HQ Imports extends [Tripal HQ](https://github.com/statonlab/tripal_hq) to support TripalImporters. Specifically, this allows users to submit Tripal Importers, administrators to review the submission and data is only inserted into Chado once the administrator approves the submission.
